# Hand Gesture Recognition Project

**This project aims to put your understanding of machine learning algorithms into practice
with a real world problem.**

## Environment

You will be needing Python3.9 or Conda to run the project.

In the same directory you will find requirements-pip.txt file that contains all the packages needed for the project to run.
   
The first option is to create a virtual environment following these steps:

1. Create a python virtual environment using the command pip -m venv .venv
2. Activate the environment by running the command .\.venv\Scripts\activate
3. Then install the package pip install -r requirements-pip.txt
4. Then use this environment to run the code

You may use python installed on the local machine directly.
You will just need to install the package using pip install -r requirements-pip.txt

## Test Cases

 1. place the folder containing the test images in the same directory and you should name it "data".The images in the directory should be numbered and it shall be read in ascending order
   
 2. Run Final.py file
   
 3. Two files are generated results.txt and time.txt

    The results.txt file contains the prediction in the same order of the images read.
    The time.txt file contains the running time.
