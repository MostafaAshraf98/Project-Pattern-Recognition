# Hand Gesture Recognition Project

**This project aims to put your understanding of machine learning algorithms into practice
with a real world problem.**
## Environment

you can download all the packages used using conda or pip
conda install --file requirements-conda.txt
or
pip install -r requirements-pip.txt


## Dataset

### Option 1: download the processed data

download https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1o9wzwaJVfrbpCFJ0rIyed1QvARh0JAtn

unzip the zipfile and put it all into `dataÂ folder`

### Option 2: run the data insertion script data_insertion.py

It will handle everything from downloading into extracting data into /data folder.

However you would need to have gdown library installed. (included in requirements.txt)
